My dumb attempt at making a Kotlin API wrapper for Discord.

#### Why...? 

By the time I've started to write this project, which I will probably never complete, I have
completely fallen for Kotlin and Scala through work projects. I just want to keep writing code
in Kotlin because it's fun, and I've always wanted to take a stab at writing an API wrapper for
Discord.
